    <h1>Context</h1>
    <p class="desc2">
      Rwanda was a colony of Germany from 1897 to 1918 until the League of Nations made it a trusteeship of Belgium following the German loss in WWI. This was a similar system to the mandate system used for the former land of the Ottoman Empire, which created the political layout of the Middle East we see today. The ruling Belgians in Rwanda tended to favor the Tutsi minority over the Hutu majority, leading to the minority Tutsis oppressing the majority Hutus. In 1959, a Hutu revolution led to many Tutsis fleeing from Rwanda and the Tutsi monarch being forced into exile, resulting in the declaration of an independent republic in Rwanda in 1962. In a military coup in 1973, Juvenal Habyarimana, a high-ranking military officer, was put into power and remained there for the next two decades through a rewrite of the constitution and uncontested elections. In 1990, a group of predominantly Tutsi refugees in Uganda known as the Rwandese Patriotic Front invaded Rwanda, and the Rwandan Civil War began. During the Rwandan Civil War, violence against Tutsis in Rwanda returned, as Habyarimana claimed they were cooperating with the Rwandese Patriotic Front. Ultimately, a ceasefire was called and the Arusha Accords were signed to stop the fighting and give the RPF power in the Rwandan Government, angering Hutu extremists.

    <h1>Causes</h1>
    <p class="desc2">
      Fueled by anti-Tutsi sentiments following the Belgians favoring the minority in the previous Belgian occupation, by the power-sharing agreement with the RPF in the Arusha Accords, and a plane crash killing Juvenal Habyarimana who had signed this agreement, Hutu extremists began to murder Tutsis and moderate Hutus, leaving a power vacuum that was temporarily filled by Hutu extremists who continued the genocide

    <h1>Impacts</h1>
    <p class="desc2">
      The genocide led to 800,000 deaths in Rwanda, mostly of the Tutsi ethnic minority. The RPF was able to reclaim power in Rwanda from the Hutu extremists, and nearly two million Hutus fled to what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The presence of Hutu militia groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has also led to conflicts there, leading to an estimated five million deaths. The Tutsi-led Rwandan government and military have invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo twice since and Congolese Tutsi rebel groups are refusing to lay down arms, claiming that doing so would subject them to genocide. The United Nations peacekeeping forces have also failed to de-escalate these conflicts.
